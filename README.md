Dear Dr. Cox and COMP 222 TAs, I'm sorry about the inconvenience of this personal REPO. 
Please understand that I was not aware that the assignment link would lock and effectively expire after my lab session on Thursday. 
I had read the lab on Wednesday but was not aware that the link would lock, so I took no action. I realized I had a time conflict and did not take any action on Thursday for the lab.

It is my best interest that this is submitted in a timely manner, via the means of email. Thank you for your time.
